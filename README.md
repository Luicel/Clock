# Clock

This is a Minecraft 1.16 plugin written using the Spigot API. It allows players to create, delete, and configure clocks, timers, and stopwatches in-game.

This was a practice project to familize myself with new concepts (annotations) and to brush up on other concepts (IO, Reflections, polymorphism, etc).
