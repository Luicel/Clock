# Clock

This is a Minecraft 1.16 plugin written using the Spigot API. It allows players to create, delete, and configure clocks, timers, and stopwatches in-game.

This project was a learning experience for me and an excuse to familize myself with new concepts (annotations) and to brush up on others (IO, Reflections, polymorphism, etc).

### Commands

```
Clock
  /clock info
  /clock reload
Timer
  /timer create <name> <seconds>
  /timer delete <name>
  /timer info <name>
  /timer list
  /timer start <name>
  /timer stop <name>
  /timer time <name> <add/remove/set> <seconds>
  /timer display <name> <none/actionbar>
Stopwatch
  /stopwatch create <name>
  /stopwatch delete <name>
  /stopwatch info <name>
  /stopwatch list
  /stopwatch start <name>
  /stopwatch stop <name>
  /stopwatch lap <name>
  /stopwatch reset <name>
  /stopwatch display <name> <none/actionbar>
```

### Config

```
Soon...
